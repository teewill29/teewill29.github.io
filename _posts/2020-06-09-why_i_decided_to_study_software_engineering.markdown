I'm the Director of Development for the worship department at my church. One of my job descriptions is to help develop those who are signing up and being onboarded onto our team. One day I had a thought: if we had an app, we could streamline a few of our more tedious processes, save on costs and stay more connected with those in our onboarding program.

Rather than hiring someone, I wondered how difficult it would be to develop the app myself. I submersed myself into YouTube tutorials and began developing the app. 5 months later, we're preparing to roll it out to our people for beta testing.

I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the process and challenges that came with the app, so I decided to do some research on what it would take to change careers and go into app or web development. That's when I came across Flatiron School and decided to apply! The rest is history!
